work with Sporta and VTTL resources

## current content:

- Get-TTFrenoy: submit the club ID's for VTTL and / or Sporta, and get the members and match details
- New-TTCicalendar: create a calendar ( to import into Google Calendar a.o. ) based on the generated matches csv
- PPmodel: image of the Power Pivot model I created after importing the matches csv

! The latest version gets the last 5 seasons to analyze, but the calendar creation is still based on a version where only the current season was downloaded. You will need to apply some filters or copy a subset of the wedstrijden.csv before creating the calendar file.
